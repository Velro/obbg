Possible tasks to work on next:

   -  add skylight
   -  more work on terrain -- zmc pseudo-wang tile approach
   -  fix depth fighting when far from origin
   -  check for memory leaks
   -  dynamically set view distance
   -  limit mesh cache to max size
   -  disk save/load
      - lz4 compression?
   -  user block create/destroy (needs raycast?)
   -  object (non-terrain) rendering
      - what model-file format?
      - animation? skinning?
      - procedural animation of characters?
   -  physics representation (1 bit per block? run-length? 1-byte min, 1-byte max, bits within that range?)
   -  "physics" (e.g. move on ground, needs physics rep)
   -  raycast (needs physics rep)
   -  use more block types
   -  improved height-field terrain 
   -  other terrain features
   -  texture improvements
     -  tweak pixar textures to be more grey so can dynamically recolor
     -  find better open textures or pay someone to make them
   -  add better lighting
   -  optimize mesh building
   -  optimize terrain generation

Not right now:

   -  shoot guns
   -  networking
